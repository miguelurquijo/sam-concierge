# **LaHaus AI Concierge: Enhanced Implementation Plan**

## **Phase 0: Project Setup & Structure**

*Setting up the project structure and organizing files*

* Create the main project directory structure  
* Set up virtual environment and requirements.txt  
* Create the basic file structure:  
  * app.py (main Flask application)  
  * agent.py (LangChain agent configuration)  
  * search.py (property search functionality)  
  * templates.py (WhatsApp message templates)  
  * utils.py (helper functions)  
  * config.py (configuration variables)  
* Set up .env file for environment variables (API keys, etc.)  
* Configure .gitignore file for sensitive information  
* Create sample data directory structure  
* Set up basic logging configuration  
* Document the project structure with a README.md file
* Use Python 3.x on the back end with standard libraries (flask optional if needed).

## **Phase 1: LangChain Setup & Search Tool Integration**

*Setting up the framework and converting the search functionality into a tool*

* Install and configure LangChain and required dependencies  
* Convert the existing search function into a LangChain Tool  
* Define input/output schemas for the search tool  
* Implement filter extraction from natural language queries  
* Add result formatting for WhatsApp-friendly responses  
* Create sample property data structure for testing  
* Test the tool with sample queries  
* Document the tool with usage examples

## **Phase 2: Agent System Prompt & Configuration**

*Designing the agent with LangChain components*

* Craft the system prompt with agent persona and conversation style  
* Configure a ChatOpenAI instance with appropriate parameters  
* Set up function calling capabilities for the search tool  
* Create the OpenAI Functions Agent using LangChain  
* Implement ConversationBufferMemory for context retention  
* Configure the AgentExecutor with the tools and memory  
* Test basic conversation flows with the agent  
* Document the agent configuration

## **Phase 3: Property Response Templates**

*Creating structured formats for property information*

* Design WhatsApp-friendly templates for property listings  
* Create formats for single property detailed view  
* Implement templates for multiple property summaries  
* Add formatting functions for prices, dates, and amenities  
* Create helper functions for truncating and formatting text  
* Design templates for calls-to-action and next steps  
* Test template rendering with various property types  
* Document the template system

## **Phase 4: WhatsApp Integration with Twilio**

*Connecting the LangChain agent to WhatsApp*

* Update the Flask webhook to use the LangChain agent  
* Implement message parsing and preprocessing  
* Add response formatting for WhatsApp constraints  
* Create conversation ID mapping for multiple users  
* Implement rate limiting and message queuing  
* Add error handling and recovery mechanisms  
* Test with simulated WhatsApp messages  
* Document the integration configuration

## **Phase 5: Enhanced Conversation Flow**

*Improving the conversation experience with advanced patterns*

* Implement conversation session management  
* Add proactive follow-up questions about preferences  
* Create handlers for clarification requests  
* Implement feedback collection on recommendations  
* Add conversation state tracking  
* Create mechanisms for graceful topic transitions  
* Test multi-turn conversation scenarios  
* Document conversation patterns and flows

## **Phase 6: Vector Database Implementation (Optional)**

*Upgrading to a proper vector database for better search performance*

* Set up Chroma or FAISS as a simple vector database  
* Migrate pre-computed embeddings to the vector database  
* Update the search tool to use the vector database  
* Implement hybrid search (filters \+ semantic)  
* Add relevance scoring improvements  
* Test search performance with the new database  
* Document the vector database setup

## **Phase 7: Testing & Refinement**

*Creating a testing framework to evaluate and improve the agent*

* Design test conversation scenarios  
* Create an automated testing harness  
* Implement performance metrics collection  
* Add conversation analytics  
* Create a feedback loop for agent improvements  
* Test with various user personas and query types  
* Document testing procedures and results

## **Phase 8: Demo Preparation & Documentation**

*Finalizing the system for demonstration*

* Create a simple demo script showcasing key features  
* Prepare sample user journeys for demonstration  
* Document system architecture and components  
* Create setup instructions for new environments  
* Add monitoring and logging for the demo  
* Prepare troubleshooting guide  
* Create user guide for the demo  
* Finalize documentation package

## **Implementation Notes**

1. **LangChain Benefits**:  
   * Reduces custom code for agent orchestration  
   * Provides built-in conversation memory  
   * Simplifies tool integration and function calling  
   * Offers ready-made components for most needs  
2. **Function Calling Approach**:  
   * Creates clear separation between conversation and search logic  
   * Reduces prompt engineering complexity  
   * Minimizes hallucination risk for property details  
   * Makes the system more maintainable  
3. **Template System**:  
   * Ensures consistent presentation of property information  
   * Optimizes for WhatsApp's formatting constraints  
   * Improves readability on mobile devices  
   * Makes responses more professional

This enhanced implementation plan maintains the phase-by-phase approach where each component can be developed in a single Claude session, while incorporating the recommended enhancements that will make the demo more robust and impressive without unnecessary complexity.
