# **LaHaus AI Concierge: Project Overview**

## **Project Summary**

This project combines a WhatsApp communication channel with an AI-powered real estate search engine to create an intelligent concierge service for LaHaus. The system allows potential buyers to interact conversationally via WhatsApp, specifying their property preferences in natural language. The AI agent then uses a semantic search tool to find matching properties from LaHaus's inventory and provides personalized recommendations.

## **Architecture Components**

### **1\. WhatsApp Integration (Twilio)**

* Uses Twilio's API to send/receive WhatsApp messages  
* Flask webhook server handles incoming messages  
* Ngrok creates secure tunnels for local development  
* Conversation history tracking for contextual interactions

### **2\. AI Conversation Agent (OpenAI)**

* GPT-4o powers the conversational interface  
* Personalized agent profile ("Karol from LaHaus")  
* Maintains conversation context and history  
* Professional but relaxed communication style  
* Goal-oriented sales approach

### **3\. Semantic Property Search Engine**

* Pre-computed embeddings for all properties using OpenAI's embedding model  
* Natural language query processing  
* Both explicit filter criteria extraction and semantic matching  
* Location boosting for neighborhood-specific queries  
* Ranked results based on relevance scoring

## **Data Flow**

1. **User Query Reception**:  
   * Client sends property requirements via WhatsApp  
   * Twilio forwards message to Flask webhook  
   * Message added to conversation history  
2. **Query Processing**:  
   * AI agent parses natural language query  
   * Explicit criteria extracted (price, bedrooms, location, etc.)  
   * Query transformed into structured search parameters  
3. **Property Search**:  
   * Flask backend applies strict filters to reduce candidate set  
   * Generates embedding for query text  
   * Calculates similarity scores with pre-computed property embeddings  
   * Ranks properties by relevance  
4. **Response Generation**:  
   * AI agent receives top matching properties (limited to \~20)  
   * Contextualizes information based on user's needs  
   * Creates personalized response with relevant options  
   * Properly formats information for WhatsApp display  
5. **Conversation Continuation**:  
   * Agent maintains context about discussed properties  
   * Can answer follow-up questions about specific properties  
   * Guides user toward scheduling viewings or connecting with human agents

## **Technical Implementation**

### **Search Engine Components**

* **Pre-indexing System**: Processes property inventory and generates embeddings  
* **Filter Extraction**: Identifies explicit criteria from natural language  
* **Vector Database**: JSON-based storage of properties with embedded vectors  
* **Ranking Algorithm**: Combines explicit filters and semantic similarity

### **WhatsApp Integration**

* **Flask Server**: Handles webhook callbacks from Twilio  
* **Conversation Management**: Tracks user history and context  
* **Message Formatting**: Ensures responses are properly formatted for WhatsApp

### **AI Agent Configuration**

* **System Prompt**: Defines agent personality and knowledge base  
* **Context Management**: Updates available property information based on search results  
* **Response Generation**: Creates concise, informative messages suitable for mobile display

## **Advantages Over Current System**

1. **Scalability**: Can effectively handle the entire property inventory  
2. **Precision**: Provides more accurate recommendations through semantic matching  
3. **Context Management**: Dynamically updates available information based on user queries  
4. **Reduced Hallucination**: AI only receives verified information about relevant properties  
5. **Token Efficiency**: Optimizes context window usage by focusing on relevant properties  
6. **Personalization**: Tailors recommendations to specific user criteria

## **Implementation Plan**

1. Integrate the existing WhatsApp connector with the semantic search API  
2. Modify the AI system prompt to utilize the search tool effectively  
3. Create a context management system to track discussed properties  
4. Implement structured response templates for property information  
5. Add conversation flows for scheduling viewings and connecting with human agents  
6. Develop monitoring and analytics for conversation effectiveness

## **Security and Privacy Considerations**

* Secure API key storage and management  
* Encryption of conversation data  
* Proper handling of personally identifiable information  
* Compliance with relevant messaging regulations

This overview provides a blueprint for developing the LaHaus AI Concierge system by combining the existing WhatsApp integration with the semantic search functionality, creating a powerful tool for real estate sales and customer engagement.
