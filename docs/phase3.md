# Phase 3: Property Response Templates

## Overview

This phase focused on creating WhatsApp-friendly templates for displaying property information. The goal was to design a comprehensive set of formatting utilities and templates that can:

1. Present property information in a clear, structured format
2. Optimize display for WhatsApp's constraints
3. Support multiple display formats for different contexts
4. Provide consistent and professional presentation

## Implementation Details

### Formatting Utilities

The implementation includes several helper functions for formatting specific types of data:

- **`format_price`**: Formats prices with Colombian peso style (periods as thousand separators)
- **`format_amenities`**: Displays amenities with appropriate icons and supports different display styles
- **`format_date`**: Converts ISO dates to user-friendly formats in Spanish
- **`truncate_text`**: Handles long text by truncating at appropriate word boundaries
- **`add_line_breaks`**: Improves readability by adding line breaks for mobile display
- **`format_location`**: Standardizes the display of location information

### Property Display Templates

Several templates were created for displaying property information in different contexts:

- **`format_property_card`**: Comprehensive single property view with detailed information
- **`format_property_brief`**: Condensed view for showing key property details
- **`format_property_comparison`**: Side-by-side comparison of multiple properties
- **`format_property_list`**: Formatted list of multiple properties
- **`format_property_gallery`**: Minimal details display for showing many properties

### Response Templates

Additional templates were created to handle various conversation scenarios:

- **`format_no_results_message`**: User-friendly messaging when no properties match criteria
- **`format_filter_summary`**: Summary of search filters extracted from user queries
- **`format_viewing_request`**: Template for scheduling property viewings
- **`format_contact_agent_request`**: Template for connecting with a human agent
- **`format_whatsapp_message`**: General function for handling WhatsApp message constraints
- **`format_welcome_message`**: Initial greeting for new conversations
- **`format_search_instructions`**: Help message explaining how to search for properties
- **`format_follow_up_questions`**: Dynamically generated follow-up questions based on context

## Design Considerations

### WhatsApp Constraints

WhatsApp has specific formatting limitations that were addressed:

- **Message Length**: Functions handle the 4096 character limit by truncating at logical points
- **Formatting**: WhatsApp supports limited Markdown-style formatting (bold, italic) which is utilized
- **Line Breaks**: Templates use appropriate line breaks to improve readability on mobile
- **Emojis**: Strategic use of emojis to make messages visually engaging but not overwhelming

### User Experience

The templates were designed with user experience in mind:

- **Progressive disclosure**: Show important details first, with options for more information
- **Visual hierarchy**: Clear structure that separates sections with appropriate formatting
- **Scannable content**: Easy to skim for key information (price, bedrooms, location)
- **Call to action**: Each template includes clear next steps for the user

### Error Handling

Templates include built-in error handling:

- Graceful handling of missing property data
- Fallback options when key information is unavailable
- Appropriate error messages that don't expose technical details

## Testing

A comprehensive test suite (`test_templates.py`) was created to verify:

- Correct formatting of all utility functions
- Proper display of property information in various templates
- Appropriate handling of edge cases and errors
- Consistent behavior across different types of properties

## Next Steps

1. Integration with the WhatsApp webhook in Phase 4
2. Enhancing templates with real property data from the backend
3. Adding support for media (images) in future versions
4. Optimizing message flow for multi-turn conversations
