# LaHaus AI Concierge: Phase 1 Summary

## Phase 1: LangChain Setup & Search Tool Integration

In this phase, we successfully set up the LangChain framework and created an enhanced property search tool that processes natural language queries.

### Key Accomplishments

1. **Enhanced Property Search Tool**:
   - Created a robust search tool using the LangChain `@tool` decorator
   - Implemented sophisticated filter extraction for property attributes:
     - Price ranges with support for Colombian peso formatting
     - Bedrooms and bathrooms specifications
     - Location/neighborhood preferences
     - Property types (apartments, houses)
     - Amenities (pool, gym, security, etc.)
   - Added property ranking based on relevance to user query
   - Designed proper error handling and fallback mechanisms

2. **Professional Response Templates**:
   - Designed WhatsApp-friendly message templates for property listings
   - Created a hierarchy of templates from brief to detailed
   - Implemented proper formatting for special fields (price, amenities)
   - Added emoji support for better visual representation
   - Created welcome messages and filter summaries

3. **Tool Integration Framework**:
   - Implemented a tool factory pattern for easy tool management
   - Set up proper structure for future tool additions
   - Created utility functions for property management

4. **Enhanced Agent Configuration**:
   - Improved the system prompt with detailed guidance
   - Added proper Spanish language support
   - Enhanced conversation handling for better user experience
   - Implemented first-message detection and welcome responses

5. **Testing Framework**:
   - Created comprehensive unit tests for search functionality
   - Added test cases for filter extraction and template formatting
   - Implemented property lookup tests

### Files Created/Modified

- **New Files**:
  - `app/tools.py`: Tool factory for LangChain tools
  - `docs/phase1.md`: Documentation of Phase 1 implementation
  - `.env.dev`: Sample environment file

- **Enhanced Files**:
  - `app/search.py`: Complete rewrite with filter extraction and ranking
  - `app/templates.py`: Comprehensive message formatting
  - `app/agent.py`: Improved agent configuration
  - `tests/test_search.py`: Enhanced test coverage

### Next Steps

The groundwork has been laid for Phase 2, where we will focus on:

1. Further agent system prompt refinement
2. Conversation context management
3. Enhanced property response templates
4. Twilio webhook integration refinement

All the core elements are now in place for a functional property search system powered by natural language processing.
